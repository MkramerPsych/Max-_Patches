This folder contains adapted versions of the Max Patches so they can be opened inside Ableton as Max Instruments. The patches adapted are;

-Parsing_Seaboard_MIDI_Data: Showing how MIDI data on all channels can be inputted into Max 4 Live

-Poly_Sine_Synth: Showing how a simple polyphonic Sine Wave Synth can be created in Max 4 Live

- Poly_FM_Synth: Showing how a simple polyphonic FM synth can be created in Max 4 Live with a parameter (Harmonic Scale) can be MIDI mapped in Ableton 

To get Ableton to see the Max 4 Live patches, please move the contents of the Max Instrument folder to;
~/Music/Ableton/User Library/Presets/Instruments/Max Instruments

Also contained in this folder is an Ableton project that will open with a default Max Instrument patch inserted in the main instrument track. This patch is also set-up to allow   multiple MIDI channels to be able to be inputted into a single instrument track. It achieves this by using 10 MIDI channels that input and pass only one MIDI channel each.

To open one of the Max4Live adapted patches, just drag one into the instrument track containing the default Max patch.

**Please note** Ableton does not input Poly Aftertouch, so when using Ableton and Max 4 Live, please switch to Channel Pressure in the Seaboard Grand Software.
