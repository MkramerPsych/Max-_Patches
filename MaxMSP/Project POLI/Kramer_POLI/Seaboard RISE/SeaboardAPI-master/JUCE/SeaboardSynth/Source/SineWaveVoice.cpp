 This file implements a simple structure for a sine wave voice. 
 We inherit the SeaboardVoice class, which provides methods for 
 starting/stopping notes, and responding to incoming midi messages.
 
 The renderNextBlock() function is where we render our audio blocks,
 and is the key function for audio synthesis.
